# Advent-of-Code-2024

This repo presnts my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles. The Advent of Code is an annual christmas themed coding challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new puzzle is released that can be solved using any programming language. The puzzles are designed to be fun and challenging, and are a great way to learn new programming concepts.

Through this iteration, I also aim to learn and practice other programming languages (well that was that xD), such as Rust, apart from the usual Python and CPP that I use.
